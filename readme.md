### Wii sports resort apocalypse

This is a mod for wii sports resort (2009) that gives the game a generally darker theme.
Feel free to showcase the mod in a video, so long as you credit me.
This mod currently only works for American 1.1 versions of the game.

### How to use

For dolphin users: Right click on your game -> Start with Riivolution Patches... then go to Riivolution scripts and choose wiisportsresortapocalypse.xml. Make sure that you have the WiiSportsResortApocalypse as the sd root.

For Wii users: You need to have riivolution installed for this to work. See https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Riivolution. Extract WSRAv1.7z to the root of your sd card and stick it in your Wii. Open up riivolution (with your American v1.1 copy of wsr in) and make sure it is enabled.

### Extra info

Please keep in mind I have done minimal testing, and as such there may be bugs. Feel free to report anything you find to me!
All I have dones so far is replace the swords in swordplay duel with katanas, and replaced the airship with a boeing 787.
Feel free to suggest anything! If you would like to contact me, my discord is Dylan!#1185.
